Ask an image model for a "sprite sheet" and you know what you get: a character whose face changes every frame, a background that won't key out, poses that overlap and drift off-grid, and a PNG your game engine can't actually consume. Cute demo, useless asset.

`sprite-gen` is a Codex/Claude skill and a Python CLI that closes that gap. Give it **one base image** — it drives generation row by row, locks the character's identity, strips the chroma background to real alpha, extracts each pose as a clean transparent frame, and bakes a runtime atlas **with a machine-readable `manifest.json.frame_layout`**. Or hand the same still to a video model and get back a seamless, transparent loop per motion state. For the last 10% that generation never gets right, a **curation webview** lets you compare, reject, nudge and watch the loop live before you bake.

For side sprites, `video-set` uses `--facing right|left` consistently across canvas placement and clip prompts. Its direction detector is **record-only by default** (`--facing-fix none`) and can be wrong even at high confidence. Use `gen --ref image.png --facing right` to request orientation in the generation prompt; `gen` otherwise preserves orientation. Prompts request direction but cannot guarantee the result. Correction is opt-in: `--facing-fix mirror`, or `gen --facing-fix regen`; review the still before using either. See [facing options](SKILL.md#side-view-facing).

## Start with a request

Ask for **sprites** or **an image**. The agent checks access, asks only for missing provider/motion choices, runs the existing pipeline, and delivers the files. The curation view is optional. Save your choices once to reuse separate sprite and image defaults; a one-off request does not overwrite them. [User workflow and defaults](docs/user-workflow.md).

## Pipelines, independent tools and scenes

The two sprite pipelines are ordered generation flows. Tool groups contain independent commands; scene creation is an optional workflow that consumes finished assets. `sprite-gen --help` prints this map and groups commands by the code domain that owns them.

| Pipeline / tool group / workflow | What goes in → what comes out | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| **A · atlas rows** | one still + a list of states → `sprite-sheet-alpha.png` + `manifest.json.frame_layout`, with **Breathe** baked on idle poses | [run-contract](docs/run-contract.md) · [breathing](docs/breathing.md) |
| **B · video → loop** | one still → per state, a seamless transparent GIF / WebP / strip, animated by Grok Imagine and cut at its true period | [video-pipeline](docs/video-pipeline.md) · [video](docs/video.md) |
| **C · utilities** | an imported image or grid sheet → clean transparent cuts; a finished atlas → a curator-ready run | [sheet-slicing](docs/sheet-slicing.md) · [curation](docs/curation.md) |
| **D · post-processing** | a finished sheet → deterministic colourways, rig layer composites, Aseprite / Phaser / Flame exports | [recolor](docs/recolor.md) · [layer-tracks](docs/layer-tracks.md) · [engine-export](docs/engine-export.md) |
| **E · asset tools** | independent PNGs or animations → repeating tiles, projected shadows, motion/contact measurements | [asset-tools](docs/asset-tools.md) |
| **S · scene** | existing assets + placement, camera and lighting → PNG frames, MP4/GIF, inspection and placement metadata | [scene](docs/scene.md) |

## What you actually get

- **A transparent sprite atlas** (`sprite-sheet-alpha.png`) — real alpha, no leftover chroma fringe, verified against white backgrounds ([why the extractor unmixes instead of peeling](docs/chroma-alpha.md)).
- **A runtime manifest** (`manifest.json.frame_layout`) — absolute frame rectangles, per-state fps and loop flags. Your engine samples rectangles; it never guesses a grid.
- **Breathe** — a still idle becomes a living loop, deterministic squash & stretch baked on your curated frames from one sidecar field, anatomy-aware and pixel-true ([details](docs/breathing.md)).
- **Pixel-art that stays on grid** — the Backbone Lattice measures one grid for the whole subject and holds every cut to it ([details](docs/pixel-unfake.md)).
- **Motion loops from video** — jumps get a tall canvas, attacks a wide one, the loop point is the clip's own period, and a one-shot action is cut rest → action → rest ([details](docs/video-pipeline.md)).
- **Deterministic colourways** — `recolor` bakes N variant sheets from a palette map; same input, same output bytes ([details](docs/recolor.md)).
- **QA you can watch** — per-state GIFs and contact sheets, so motion is judged as motion before anything ships. Cyclic locomotion (walk/run) stays experimental unless motion QA actually passes.
- **Independent asset tools** — build repeating backgrounds, project shadows from a foot anchor, and inspect timing, duplicate poses and contact evidence. Ambiguous feet produce an unverified measurement ([details](docs/asset-tools.md)).
- **Optional scene creation** — place existing PNGs, external frame sequences, loop strips or runtime atlases on named planes, with camera motion and shared shadow projection. Sprite generation can finish before this step ([details](docs/scene.md)).

## Quickstart

```bash
# install (Pillow, NumPy) into a fresh virtualenv — the venv is the only supported interpreter
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
sprite-gen --help
```

**A · atlas rows** — one still to a runtime atlas.

```bash
sprite-gen prepare --out-dir <run> --character-id <id> --base-image base.png   # request, guides, prompts
sprite-gen gen-set --run-dir <run> --provider codex                            # every state row, 4 at a time
sprite-gen extract --run-dir <run>                                             # chroma → transparent frames
sprite-gen compose-atlas --run-dir <run>                                       # sprite-sheet-alpha.png + manifest.json
sprite-gen curation --run-dir <run>                                            # (optional) pick, nudge, breathe
```

**B · video → loop** — one still to transparent loops (needs `ffmpeg`, `img2webp`, and your own `grok` login or `XAI_API_KEY`).

```bash
sprite-gen video-set --base side=still.png --states idle,walk,run,jump,attack --out-dir set/
# per item: video-canvas → video → video-frames → video-loop; set/table.md names every result
```

**C · utilities** — each stands alone.

```bash
sprite-gen cutout icon.png --white-check              # white/ivory → matte, magenta/green → chroma engine
sprite-gen slice-sheet --sheet sheet.png --chroma-key magenta --grid 3x2   # multi-figure sheet → per-cell cuts
sprite-gen unpack-atlas --atlas sheet.png             # finished atlas → curator-ready run (or --pngs-dir folder/)
```

**D · post-processing** — refine a finished sheet without regenerating.

```bash
sprite-gen recolor-palette --base <run>/sprite-sheet-alpha.png --out palette.draft.json
sprite-gen recolor --run-dir <run> --spec recolor.spec.json      # → <run>/variants/
sprite-gen compose-layers --run-dir <run>                        # rig runs: declared stacks → <run>/layers/
sprite-gen export-aseprite --run-dir <run>                       # Aseprite JSON for Phaser / Flame
```

**E · asset tools** — each accepts existing assets, including artwork from other tools.

```bash
sprite-gen background-tile --source background.png --period 512 --overlap 32 --out tile.png
sprite-gen shadow --source walk.strip.json --out-dir shadows/
sprite-gen inspect-motion --source walk.strip.json --out motion.json
# Only with known same-foot contact and an isolated foot ROI:
sprite-gen inspect-motion --source walk.strip.json --contacts 0:4 --foot-box 20,70,32,10 --out stance.json
```

**S · scene** — an optional composition workflow. The [scene contract](docs/scene.md) includes a complete spec.

```bash
sprite-gen scene-render --spec scene.json --out-dir render/ --formats png,mp4 --export-layers
sprite-gen scene-inspect --spec scene.json --out scene-check.json
```

The agent-facing workflow, gates and contracts live in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md).

## Install as a skill

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py \
  --repo aldegad/sprite-gen --path . --name sprite-gen
```

Image generation is part of this engine (`sprite_gen.gen`, providers `codex` and `grok` on a subscription you already pay for, plus an explicit-only `openai` provider for servers and SaaS that bills per call; the general `image-gen` skill is a thin shuttle over it). Video uses **your own** credential — the `grok` CLI login or an `XAI_API_KEY` — and nothing is shipped with the repo ([docs/video.md](docs/video.md)).

`sprite-gen` supports CPython 3.11+; CI runs only 3.14. Python 3.10 is no longer supported. The quickstart needs a Python with working `venv`/`ensurepip`.
