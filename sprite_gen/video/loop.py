"""`sprite-gen video-loop` — cut one seamless cycle out of keyed frames and emit the
loop as cycle frames, a horizontal strip (+ metadata), a transparent GIF and a WebP.

Period first, seam second. A single-start "most similar later frame" search lands
on the 1.5-cycle look-alike of a gait (legs swapped) and produces a loop that
hitches at the wrap (2026-09-08 실측: side walk picked 39 frames where the period
was 28, run picked 25 where it was 17). So the true period is read from the
GLOBAL profile `P[L] = mean_j |f[j] - f[j+L]|` — its deepest local minimum inside
the state's window — and only then is the start chosen as the best seam for that
period. Gaits also compare the motion around the two cycle boundaries so an
accidental single-frame seam cannot outrank a coherent repeat. Idle motion is
tiny and not strictly periodic: its window is opened to
most of the clip, where the seam is lowest.

Everything downstream is measured, never assumed: the seam ratio (wrap distance
over the mean adjacent-frame distance inside the cycle) gates the run, the GIF and
WebP are re-opened and verified (frame count, loop flag, transparent corners,
no stale RGB under alpha 0). The strip metadata carries `body_h` — the standing
body height (median per-frame bbox height) — so a consumer can scale a jump strip,
whose cells include air room, to the same on-screen body size as a walk strip.

# A gait's period is a fact about the body, not about how long the clip runs: the
# same walker takes the same ~1 s stride in a 3 s clip and a 6 s clip. A window cut
# from the clip length (the fractions below) shrank with the clip and, at 3 s, put a
# 1.0-1.3 s stride above the walk ceiling (measured 2026-09-18: one of four walks refused
# outright, another cut at a half step). Gait states therefore take their window in
# seconds — physical bounds on how fast and how slow a locomotion cycle can be — capped
# above by half the clip, the most a detector can *confirm* repeats (a cycle must be seen
# twice to be a cycle at all). The ceiling is a bound in seconds and not simply "half
# the clip" because the periodicity gate compares the period's dip with the profile's
# mean over the whole window: a ceiling that grows with the clip drags in long, sparsely
# sampled lags, inflates that mean, and let a clip with ONE hop and a jittering stand
