Animation action: {entry["action"]}.

Anchor lock:
- Accepted idle/direction anchors own character identity, outfit details, colors, face design, asymmetric markings, and side-specific accessories for final action rows.
- Base character images and original character sheets are pre-idle sources only. Do not reinterpret or reintroduce base-character details inside a direction-anchor action row.
- This row owns motion only. Spend the variation budget on limb contacts, arm counter-swing, body height, torso lean, head bob, hair bounce, and loop continuity.
- Do not redesign or reinterpret identity details while animating. Keep face, hair shape, markings, palette, outline weight, body proportions, outfit, props, and silhouette copied from the approved anchors.
- Preserve side-specific features exactly as the approved anchors show them. Do not solve hairpin side, earring side, logos, handed props, scars, one-sided markings, asymmetric clothing, or lighting cues from scratch inside the row.
- When generating a paired left/right row, use the paired row reference only for timing, scale, and animation intensity. Rotate the body, feet, shoulders, face angle, and gaze to the target facing, but keep identity details attached according to the accepted target-direction anchor.
- For cyclic locomotion, do not let a single running/walking pose anchor determine every frame's leg phase. When a multi-pose motion reference is attached, use it for foot contacts.
- Prefer a subtler animation over any change that mutates the character identity.
{state_requirement_text}

Transparency and artifact rules:
{transparency_artifact_text}

Layout requirements:
- Exactly {frames} full-body frames, left to right, in one horizontal row.
- The attached layout guide shows the {frames} frame boxes, inner safe area, and centers for this row. Follow its slot count, spacing, centering, and padding.
- Do not reproduce the layout guide itself: no visible boxes, guide lines, center marks, labels, guide colors, or guide background may appear in the output.
- Treat the image as {frames} equal-width invisible {runtime_size} frame slots. Fill every slot: each requested slot must contain exactly one complete full-body pose.
- Spread the {frames} poses evenly across the whole image width. Do not leave any requested slot blank or create large empty gaps between poses.
- Center one complete pose in each slot. No pose may cross into the neighboring slot.
- Use a perfectly flat pure {chroma["name"]} {chroma["hex"]} chroma-key background across the whole image.
- Do not use {chroma["hex"]}, pure {chroma["name"]}, or chroma-adjacent colors in the character, highlights, props, shadows, or effects.
- Keep the rendering faithful to the attached reference sprite: same outline weight, same palette, same detail level — do not restyle it.
- Keep every frame self-contained with at least {safe_margin_x} px horizontal and {safe_margin_y} px vertical safe padding. No character body part should be clipped by the frame slot.
- Avoid motion blur. Use clear pose changes readable at {runtime_size}.
- Preserve the same silhouette, face, proportions, palette, material, and props across every frame.
