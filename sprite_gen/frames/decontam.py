"""Edge decontamination: give a keyed edge the subject's own colour back (`decontam: "palette"`).

The chroma engine splits a key/subject blend using the key-tint score alone. That
assumes the subject colour carries no tint of its own, which holds for grey and
white and fails for saturated colours. A red hair strand blended a third of the
way into green scores as barely tinted, so it stays opaque and olive, and when
`despill_color` does reach it the recovery overshoots into orange (the warm bias
of the `1/(1-k)` gain). Video adds a second loss: 4:2:0 chroma subsampling has
already averaged the key into the colour of every strand one or two pixels wide,
so no amount of unmixing that pixel alone can find the red again. What survives
is the luma, which the codec keeps at full resolution.

This pass explains each edge pixel as a mix of the key background, measured
locally, with one colour the subject actually owns:

    observed = alpha * P + (1 - alpha) * B

P ranges over a small palette learned from the subject's confident interior.
The pixel takes the P whose line through B passes closest to the observation;
alpha is the projection onto that line. The colour written is P's chroma at the
observation's luma: the hue comes from the subject, the light and shade from
the pixel. With a key-free palette, the output cannot carry the key's hue at
all, and no channel gain is applied, so nothing can drift warm.

Guards, in order of the decision they make:

- *Background flank.* Keyed pixels within `FLANK_PX` of the subject may regain
  coverage (the faint sides of a strand the hard cut erased), above a noise
  floor measured on the background itself, and only when chained to the subject.
- *Unexplained.* A pixel no palette colour explains (a small gem of a colour the
  interior never shows) keeps the engine's bytes. In the still fit the blend must
  also reproduce the observed luma, so outline ink darker than any mix of a
  palette colour with the key stays as the engine left it.
- *Opaque.* A band pixel that is closer to some palette colour as it is than the
  mix explains it (by `OPAQUE_MARGIN`, or three noise sigmas when the source is
  noisier) is ordinary shading, not a blend: it keeps the engine's bytes. Only
  when the subject owns no key-coloured material is a residual key hue on such a
  pixel capped (`KEY_HUE_TINT`), which lowers the keyed channels and never raises
  one.
- *Own colour (still fit).* Gold sits between red and green, so a gold a little
  darker or yellower than the palette's own also reads as a warmer palette gold
  with some green mixed in, and came out orange and see-through. The still fit
  therefore also counts a palette colour at the pixel's own luma (the freedom the
  written colour has too) when it comes within the subject's own spread: how far
  its confident interior sits from the palette (`MATERIAL_SPREAD_QUANTILE`), which
  also raises the margin a blend has to win by. And a still's antialiased edge is
  at most `_IN_BAND_UNMIX_KEY_DEPTH` pixels deep, so deeper in the band a key share
  shows only as the key's hue: a pixel without it is the subject's own colour, and
  so is an edge pixel without it that has the colour of the plain material right
  behind it. Such pixels are never blends or tints. Where the matte changed one of
  them although it carries no key hue, the source colour and coverage come back:
  the RGB matte scores tint on the channel average, which calls yellow green (and
  red or blue magenta), so it unmixes gold as if it were a blend. The video fit
  does none of this, since a decoded frame's chroma is blurred and an edge pixel's
  colour is no evidence of what the subject is made of there.
- *Tint.* Between the two: a pixel pushed from its colour toward the key by at
  least `TINT_SHIFT`, and `TINT_RATIO` times more than the fit misses by, is
  recoloured with its coverage left alone (a faint cast, not proven coverage).
- *Depth.* Coverage is refitted only within `alpha_depth` of the keyed region
  (the engine's unmix reach, same meaning). Deeper band pixels get colour only,
  so a key reflection on a solid surface is recoloured, not turned see-through.

A subject that owns key-coloured material (more than `KEY_MATERIAL_MAX_SHARE` of
its interior carries the key hue, the same test `video-frames --spill auto` runs
on its reference still) keeps that material in the palette; its edges are then
repainted with whatever explains them best, key colour included.

`fit="video"` chooses P on a 3x3 mean of the observation and averages the
projection alpha with a luma-only alpha where P and B differ in luma, because a
decoded video frame's chroma is blurred while its luma is not.

Everything here is integer-exact or a fixed sequence of float64 operations: no
random initialisation, no iteration-order dependence, the same input gives the
same bytes. The one learned component, the palette, is a histogram k-means with
a deterministic seed (greedy weighted farthest-point) and a fixed iteration count.
