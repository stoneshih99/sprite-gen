    이 정식화 이전에는 원본 float 축약식(`sum(sum(abs(...)))`)을 글자 그대로 재현해
    바이트 동일을 계약으로 삼았다. 계약을 **정확한 유리수 값**으로 교체했다 (plan
    `sprite-gen/best-phase-hotspot`): 새 값은 같은 양의 정확판이라 옛 float 누적과
    마지막 ULP 에서 갈리지만(실측 최대 상대차 1.8e-16), 파이프라인이 실제로 쓰는
    출력인 `_best_phase` 의 argmin 은 전수 동일하다(synthetic_fixture_b 8 컴포넌트 × 64 위상).

    **argmin 불변은 정리가 아니라 측정이다** — argmin 은 점수의 불연속 함수라 "점수가
    ULP 만큼 바뀌면 argmin 이 안 바뀐다"를 보장하는 정리는 없다. 뒤집히려면 서로 다른
    두 위상의 점수가 유효숫자 15자리까지 붙어야 하는데, 관측된 distinct 점수 최소 간격은
    ~1e-5 다 (validator 독립 측정 2026-07-25: 저대비 팔레트를 포함한 무작위·적대 컴포넌트
    160개에서 최소 간격 1.15e-5 vs 신·구 최대 상대차 8.39e-15 = 여유 1.4e9 배, 별도
    300 컴포넌트 argmin 불일치 0건). 점수가 수천 개 정수 유래 셀 기여분의 합이라 그렇게
    붙기 어렵다. 자기 자산에서 다시 재려면 이 두 수(점수 간격 / 상대차)를 재라.

    **"뒤집히면 새 값이 맞다" 라고는 못 쓴다** — 정확한 건 **셀 단위까지**다. `total_dev` 는
    여전히 셀 기여분을 naive float 로 누적하므로 전체 점수의 정확도 우위는 평균적 경향이지
    보장이 아니다 (maintainer 실측 2026-07-25, 격자 840개를 `Fraction` 참값과 대조: 신 값이 더
    가까움 12.6% / **구 값이 더 가까움 7.0%** / 동률 80.4%, 차이 크기는 상대 4.0e-16 이하라
    행동 영향 0). 이 문단은 한때 "뒤집혀도 새 값이 정답 쪽" 이라고 단정했는데, 그게 바로 위
    문단이 경계하라고 적은 "측정 안 한 성질을 불변식으로 박기" 였다.
    정확 동점은 양쪽 다 안전하다: 순회 순서(`for i / for j`)와 strict `<` 동점 처리가
    구 코드와 동일해 동점은 양쪽 다 첫 위상으로 간다.

    `C_lo`/`S_lo` 는 `bytes.translate` + `sum` 으로 C 레벨에서 뽑는다 — 임계값별 변환표는
    256개뿐이라 모듈 상수로 굽는다.

    `_best_phase` 가 이 코어를 (xs, ys) 로 메모이즈한다: 8단계 위상 스캔은 `_grid_edges`
    의 정수 스냅 때문에 서로 다른 위상이 **같은 정수 경계**로 자주 붕괴한다 (offset 이
    피치의 1/4 미만이면 lead=0 등). 같은 경계 → 같은 계산 → 같은 값이므로 캐시는
