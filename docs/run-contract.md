## 1. Pipeline stages

One image-gen call **per state row** is the only AI step; every stage after it is
deterministic (same input → same output). Each script does one job and reads/writes
canonical files, not hidden imports.

| Stage | Script | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prepare | `prepare_sprite_run.py` | base image + request flags/JSON | `sprite-request.json`, per-state layout guide, per-state prompt, empty `raw/`+`frames/` |
| Generate | `sprite-gen gen` (`generate_sprite_image.py`) | `prompts/<state>.txt` + refs | verified `raw/<state>.png` strip + audit raw/report |
| Extract | `extract_sprite_row_frames.py` | `raw/<state>.png` | on success: `frames/<state>/frame-N.png` (+ `.plain.png` twin on pixel-unfake runs), `frames/frames-manifest.json`; on failure: nothing in `frames/`, `extract-failure.json` instead (§6) |
| Curate (opt) | `sprite-gen curation` (`serve_curation.py`) + `curation.py` | `frames/` | `curation.json` sidecar |
| Compose | `compose_sprite_atlas.py` | `frames/` + `curation.json` | `sprite-sheet-alpha.png`, `manifest.json`, `*.report.json` |
| Engine export (opt) | `sprite-gen export-aseprite` (`sprite_gen/compose/export_aseprite.py`) | composed `manifest.json` + existing atlas | `exports/aseprite.json`, or `exports/aseprite/<state>.json` for Flame |
| Recolor (opt) | `sprite-gen recolor` / `recolor-palette` (`sprite_gen/effects/recolor.py`) | base sheet (default `sprite-sheet-alpha.png`) + recolor spec | `variants/<name>.png`, optional `variants/<name>.manifest.json`, `variants/recolor.report.json` |
| Layer bake (opt) | `sprite-gen compose-layers` (`sprite_gen/compose/compose_layers.py`) | `frames/` + `curation.json` + the request's `rig` / `layers` | `layers/<name>.png`, `layers/<name>.manifest.json`, `layers/layers.report.json` (published as one set) |
| QA | `preview_animation.py` | `frames/` | `qa/<state>-contact.png`, `qa/<state>.gif` |
| Inspect | `inspect_sprite_run.py` | `sprite-request.json`, `raw/` or `frames/` | `sprite-inspect.report.json` |
| Score | `score_sprite_run.py` | `sprite-inspect.report.json` | `sprite-score.report.json`, correction hints |
| Correction loop | `run_correction_loop.py` | run dir + optional provider command | `correction-loop.report.json`, per-attempt inspect/score/hints |
| GIF export | `compose_sprite_gif.py`, `gif_utils.py` | selected frames | clean transparent GIF into `exports/` |
| Selected cycle | `compose_selected_cycle.py` | `curation.json` / `--frames` | selected-cycle manifest + QA |
| Inverse / import | `unpack_atlas_run.py` | finished atlas **or** `--pngs-dir` | curator-ready run dir (§4) |
| Export stills | `export_curated_pngs.py` | curated `frames/` | named PNGs under `curated/` |
| Chroma guard | `scripts/dev/check_visible_magenta.py` | screenshot | leakage warning |

The happy path is `prepare -> gen -> extract -> compose`, followed by delivery and an optional curation view. Curation is opened only when requested or enabled in saved defaults; edits are composed again for export. Stage internals (chroma removal, connected
components, pixel-unfake path, the `.sprite-gen.lock` single-writer rule, the
inspect/score/loop split) are described in
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md) §2, §6 — this table is the contract, that doc
is the explanation.

## 2. Run-dir folder contract

**One worker owns exactly one character folder.** This is the canonical tree — do
not restate it elsewhere; point here.

```
Transient publish sidecars exist only during an extract/import commit: `.frames.sg-backup`
and `.extract-failure.sg-backup` (in-place rollback copies) and `.<name>.sg-rwlock` (in the
parent dir — the publish reader/writer lock). Their durability/concurrency boundary is §7.

Rules the display depends on:

- **`base-source.*` is the identity truth** and must survive independent of baking —
  the view shows it as a top reference row (§3) whether or not it was attached to any
  row. Real runs write it in Prepare; imported runs write it from `pngs/_base/` (§4).
- **`raw/<direction>_idle.png` and `raw/down_<state>.png`** are what the view resolves
  into per-state generation-material chips for real (directional-anchor) runs — the
  chip is "which anchor / basis row / guide generated this state". See
  [`directional-anchor-workflow.md`](directional-anchor-workflow.md) for the naming.
- **`references/imported/<group>/`** is the imported-run equivalent of those raw
  anchors: an imported row carries its generation material here so the view produces
  the same chips (§4).
- **`frames/<state>/frame-N.plain.png`** (pixel-unfake runs only) is the *cell-sized*
  pre-fit twin that `compose` bakes when the sidecar turns pixel-unfake off for that
  state (`states.<state>.pixel_unfake:false`, or the run-wide `pixel_unfake:false`
  default — resolver: `curation.frame_variant(curation, state)`) — the
  atlas slot is cell-sized, so this twin must be too. **`frames/<state>/orig/frame-N.png`**
  is the *hi-res* (S×cell) pre-fit twin the view displays when the user turns
  pixel-unfake off, so "off = original" is crisp instead of an upscaled cell blur.
  S is **per-row native**: the ceil of the largest component-crop / final-content-bbox
  ratio across the row's frames (bounded by `2048 // cell`), so the twin resample is a
  mild upscale — never a downscale. The old fixed ×4 cap squeezed high-pitch raws
  (synthetic_fixture_b down rows, ~14px pitch) ~3.5× and the "original" view stopped being the
  original (maintainer, 2026-07-23). The
  view prefers `orig/`, falling back to `.plain.png` when no hi-res twin exists. Both
  twins are fitted into the pixel-unfake frame's content bbox (same footprint), so the
  toggle compares pixel treatment at identical size and a plain bake keeps the same
  character size as pixel rows.
  Sidecar-baking semantics are owned by [`pixel-unfake.md`](pixel-unfake.md); the
  display contract for the toggle is §3.

The runtime `manifest.json.frame_layout` contract (absolute rects, no runtime
alpha-recovery, `degraded_static_fallback: false`) is owned by
[`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) "Runtime Contract" and is out of scope here.

## 2-b-2. Reading a run never writes to it

`sprite-request.json` has exactly one read gate (`runio.load_request`) and exactly one
schema writer (`runio.migrate_request_file`, exposed as `sprite-gen migrate-request
<run-dir> --apply`). They are separate on purpose.

- **Reads are byte-stable.** `load_request`, and everything that goes through it
  (`state_revision`, `run_revision`, `load_curation`, the view's snapshot endpoints),
  leave the run directory byte for byte identical. A retired key (`fit.pixel_perfect`)
  is normalized to the current key (`fit.pixel_unfake`) **in memory only**, so an old
  approved run keeps working without its file being touched. Both keys present is still
  a hard fail — code cannot pick which of two truths is real.
  The curation sidecar reads the same way: a generation-mismatched `curation.json` is
  salvaged row by row **in memory** and the file itself is left alone — the load gate
  writes no backup copy (see the bullet below).
- **Schema migration is an explicit command.** It is a dry run unless `--apply` is passed.
  The write takes the **publish rwlock** (`runio.publish_guard`) — the same exclusive lock
  the request editors take — re-reads the document *after* acquiring it, and replaces the
  file atomically. It deliberately does not take the pipeline `.sprite-gen.lock`: that lock
  guards stage outputs (frames, atlas), and extraction/compose never write the request, so
  holding it would look like protection while the actual competitors (reroll, interpolate,
  the view's fps edit) walked straight past it. One resource, one isolation domain.
- **Every request read-modify-write shares that one domain.** Migration, take recording
  (`reroll.record_take`, `interpolate.write_take`) and the view's fps POST all do
  *acquire → fresh re-read → atomic replace* inside `publish_guard`, so no pair of them can
  lose the other's write. Locked by named race tests plus a structural assertion that no
  production request write sits outside the guard
  (`tests/test_request_write_isolation.py`).
- **A stale backup is written by the writer, never by a read.** `curation.stale-<hash>.json`
  is created only by `curation.write_curation_atomic`, at the moment an overwrite would
  actually lose rows. The load gate used to write it while merely *judging* a
  generation-mismatched sidecar — a read that created a file in the run dir, the same class
  of defect as the incident below. Nothing is lost at drop time: `curation.json` is still
  on disk, untouched.
- **Unrelated edits preserve the on-disk key form.** Take recording (reroll / interpolate)
  and the view's fps edit reload the whole document through the gate and write it back, so
  they go out through `runio.write_request`, which folds a normalized key back to whatever
  the file actually carries. Otherwise changing one fps value would migrate the schema as a
  side effect, and "only the explicit command changes the schema" would be false the moment
  anyone edited anything.

A synthetic regression fixes the failure mode: normalizing a retired key during a
`state_revision()` query must not rewrite `sprite-request.json`, move `run_revision`, or
knock a curation sidecar stale. A query has no business changing what it reports on.

Migration does change the file bytes, so it does move `run_revision`. The curation sidecar
survives it through per-row `revision` salvage (§ `curation.load_curation_report`); rows
with no stamp are dropped as usual, and `migrate-request` prints which rows those are
*before* it writes.

## 2-c. External consumers install from `curated/`, never from `frames/`

`frames/` is the extractor's own output. Everything a human does in the curation view —
frame picks, play order, **pixel edits**, transforms, deletions, clones — lives in
`curation.json` and is applied *downstream*, not written back into `frames/`.

So an app that copies `frames/<state>/frame-N.png` into its assets **silently ships the
un-edited image**. Nothing fails: extract succeeded, the file exists, the copy succeeded.
The only signal is a human noticing their work is gone.

A synthetic regression fixes this failure mode: copying from `frames/` after a pixel edit
must not be treated as a curated export, because it would silently discard the edit.

Rules for anything outside this repo:

- **Stills / single frames** → run `export_curated_pngs.py`, install from `curated/`.
- **Animation** → consume `sprite-sheet-alpha.png` + `manifest.json` from
  `compose_sprite_atlas.py` (compose already reads `curation.json`).
- **Never** reach into `frames/` unless you are re-deriving the cache itself.
- If a tool must accept both, it **prefers `curated/` and says which one it read** — a silent
  choice between two sources is how the edit disappears.

Inside this repo the compose/GIF/atlas paths already read `frames/` *together with*
`curation.json`, which is correct; the hazard is external copying.

## 3. Curation-view display contract

`serve_curation.py` serves one run dir and returns the run snapshot at `GET /api/run`.
The webview (`sprite_gen/serve/curator/*`) renders exactly four contract elements from that
payload. **A view that omits any element it has the data for is a broken view** — the
whole point is that the experience does not vary by who launched it.

| Element | Shown when | Payload source | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Base reference row** | `base-source.*` exists | `baseUrl` (null if absent) | Top row, pure image — no preview/select UI. Identity truth, always visible. |
| **Generation-material chips** | the state has resolvable material | `states[].refs[]` — each `{role, name, url}` | Per-state header shows *what generated this row*. `role ∈ {anchor, basis, guide}`, labelled `방향 앵커` / `basis row` / `레이아웃 가이드` (i18n key `ref_<role>`). Only run-dir files that actually exist appear — **except the anchor chip** (`anchorFrame: true`), which is a live bake (`/api/anchor?direction=<dir>`) named `<state>#<index>`, because the on-disk `references/anchors/*.png` is a derived cache that goes stale the moment the user edits the anchor frame. |
| **Anchor frame** | request has a `directions` block | `directionGroups[].anchorFrame` `{state, index, source}` + `anchorError`/`anchorErrorCode`/`anchorPending`/`anchorUrl` · `curation.anchors` | The one curated instance that is this direction's identity for generating its other rows. `source: "picked"` = pinned by the human (frame card pin button → `curation.anchors.<dir>`), `"default"` = the anchor row's sequence head. The anchor card carries an `앵커` badge (tinted when pinned); an unresolvable pin surfaces `anchorError` in the status bar instead of silently reverting — archived frame (`pick-missing`) or **regenerated row** (`pick-stale-generation`: the pin carries the pinned row's `state_revision`, so a re-derived row makes the pin stale rather than silently pointing it at a different image). **`anchorPending: true` is not an error** — the anchor row is not generated yet (the normal mid-work state), so the view must not colour it as a failure. Resolution SSoT = `sprite_gen/curate/anchor.py`. |
| **Pixel grid** | **always** — the measurement cannot fail | `states[].pixelScale` (≥1, never null) + `pixelUnfake{label,scale}` + `states[].frames[].contentBox` | **Per-state** checkbox on every row's refs strip; the top checkbox is a **toggle-all** (indeterminate when mixed). Display only, never persisted. `pixelScale` is an exact test (largest k where the frame is only uniform k×k blocks; k=1 is trivially true — identity), so "unknown grid" does not exist and nothing gates on it. On the pixel-unfake view: the output raster (request scale on `fit.pixel_unfake` runs, measured k labelled `auto` otherwise). On the original (plain) view: the **final correspondence grid** — green, one cell = one result pixel. (The stage-1 cut lattice in `frames-manifest input_grids` stays diagnostic-only.) An identity grid (k=1) is a true grid, not a missing one — density is a property of the fact, not a reason to hide the control. |
| **Direction groups** | request has a `directions` block | `directionGroups[]` — `{direction, anchor, states, anchorFrame, anchorError}` + mirror entries `{direction, mirrorOf}` | States render grouped per direction with the direction anchor first (badge `방향 앵커`); mirrored directions render as an informational strip (`<src> 런타임 미러 — 생성 없음`), never as silently missing rows. Runs without the block keep the flat request order. |
| **Original-quality toggle** | **always** — every row has the control | `states[].frames[].plainUrl` + `fitPixelUnfake` | **Per-state** checkbox on every row's refs strip + zoom modal (same contract, no per-surface gating). Twin rows: on = canonical `frame-N.png`, off = `plainUrl` (hi-res `orig/` else `.plain.png`) — a **source** switch, persisted per state. Twin-less rows: on = the display renderer re-quantizes by the measured grid `pixelScale` (the same k the grid overlay draws — grid-based pixel-unfake; k=1 is identity), a **display lens**, never persisted (persisting would make the bake resolver demand a `.plain` variant that does not exist). The top-right checkbox is a toggle-all (indeterminate when mixed). |

`GET /api/run` payload — the display-relevant subset below (the full snapshot,
including non-display fields like `states[].action`, is assembled by
`build_run_state`):

`pixelUnfake.scale` is `cell.height // fit.logical_height` (integer floor), so the
example's `256 // 48 = 5` (not 5.33 — floor); `label` is `"<logical_height>px"` and
`logicalHeight` echoes `fit.logical_height`. `states[].pixelScale` mirrors that scale
on a `fit.pixel_unfake` run, or carries the per-row auto-measured block pitch on a
run with no pixel-unfake contract (import/plain), or `null` when a row's pitch cannot
be measured. Real runs are usually smaller than this synthetic 256 example — the
synthetic fixture anchor is `cell 56 / logical 48 → 56 // 48 = 1`.

Display invariants (enforced by the server, not by the launching agent):

- The base row, chips, grid, and toggle are all **derived from run-dir files** — an
  agent cannot "forget" to set them up. If a source file is missing the element is
  simply absent; there is no per-agent styling step to get wrong.
- `contentSize` (alpha bbox) is exposed so a reviewer can spot size-parity drift
  across a row without opening each frame.
- Standalone image-candidate curation (icons / logos / drafts — not sprites) and the
  webview interaction model (select/reorder/transform, `curation.json` schema,
  multi-agent launch rules) live in [`curation.md`](curation.md); this section owns
  only the four display-contract elements above.

## 4. Import-run source rule (`--pngs-dir`)

An imported run (a folder of separate PNGs, no generation pipeline) must reach the
**same** display contract as a real run: a base reference row and per-state
generation-material chips. The importer treats source material as first-class, not
just frames.

Import folder layout accepted by `unpack_atlas_run.py --pngs-dir <dir>`:

```text
pngs/
  _base/<any>.png            # optional — identity/base image for the whole set
  <group-a>/                 # one subfolder = one curator row (state)
    1-name.png               # frames; numeric prefix sets play order
    2-name.png
    _refs/                   # optional — this row's generation material
      anchor-<name>.png      #   role = direction anchor
      basis-<name>.png       #   role = basis row
      guide-<name>.png       #   role = layout guide
  <group-b>/ ...
  meta.json                  # optional — human labels + iso tile/anchor (§3 grid overlay)
```

Mapping into the run dir (so both view code paths resolve identically):

- `pngs/_base/<img>` → `base-source.png` → drives the base reference row (`baseUrl`).
- `pngs/<group>/<frames>.png` → `frames/<group>/frame-N.png` → the row's frames.
- `pngs/<group>/_refs/<role>-<name>.png` → `references/imported/<group>/<role>-<name>.png`
  → the row's generation-material chips. The role is the filename prefix and **must** be
  `anchor` / `basis` / `guide` (same vocabulary as §3, owned by `curation.IMPORTED_REF_ROLES`).
  A `_refs` file with any other prefix is malformed input: the importer **fails loud**
  (lists the offending files) — it never silently relabels an unknown role as `guide`.

`serve_curation.py`'s `_state_refs` resolves chips from `raw/` anchors for real runs
and from `references/imported/<group>/` for imported runs — one chip vocabulary, two
sources, identical rendering. A `_base`/`_refs`-free import still works (frames only,
no base row, no chips), but then the view honestly shows "no source material" rather
than a divergent experience.

**`--force` re-import is a writer-isolated, rollback-safe, reader-atomic rebuild.** It
validates all inputs, builds the new run into a staging dir, then publishes it over the
run dir. A **successful** re-import reflects **only** the current input — removing a
`_base`/`_refs` source and re-importing leaves no stale `base-source.png` /
`references/imported/*` behind, so provenance (`unpack-source.json`) and the served view
never disagree (Idempotency/SSoT: the result never depends on the prior out-dir state).
A **failed or invalid** re-import (e.g. a bad `_refs` role) leaves the prior run
**byte-intact** — it is never cleared-then-failed (write-side Atomicity: a rebuild fully
succeeds or rolls back). The publish holds the run-dir single-writer lock in place
throughout, so a concurrent **writer** cannot preempt (writer Isolation).

## 5. Conformance status

All four contracts are enforced by the shipped scripts today:

- Stage table (§1), folder tree (§2), and the base-row / chips / grid elements of §3.
- The "off = original quality" toggle (§3): extract writes a hi-res `orig/` twin the
  view prefers, so pp-off is crisp; the cell-sized `.plain.png` stays for the `compose`
  bake. Canonical `frame-N.png` bytes are unchanged (deterministic — verified
  byte-identical on re-extraction of hero v6/v7).
- The `--pngs-dir` `_base`/`_refs` embedding (§4): imported runs reach the same base
  row + chips as real runs.
- The view-contract self-report (§3): serve_curation logs base/refs/grid coverage at
  startup and warns on a sourceless view.

Verified end-to-end on three views — hero v6 (`base=yes refs=12/12 grid=yes`),
synthetic fixture (`refs=36/36`, anchor/basis/guide chips across down/side/up), and a
comprehensive `_base`+`_refs` import — plus a sourceless run that emits the warning.

## 6. Failed extract is atomic — no partial generation in `frames/`

Canonical `frames/` only ever holds a **complete** generation. A failed extract — the
**first** extract on a fresh run *or* a re-extract — publishes **nothing** to `frames/`
(strict whole-generation Atomicity: the operation fully succeeds or leaves canonical state
untouched). A failed re-extract additionally leaves the prior complete generation
byte-intact, and the frames publish stays reader-atomic under `publish_guard` (§4).

The per-state failure signal is **not** discarded — it is written **outside** `frames/` as
`extract-failure.json` in the run-dir root, so it stays observable (No Silent Fallback) and
still drives the automatic correction loop:

- `extract-failure.json` holds the **union of the run's currently-unresolved per-state
  failures** — `ok:false`, per-state `errors`/`warnings` — and the CLI exits `1`.
- The **automatic correction loop** consumes it: `inspect._manifest_state_notes` reads the
  per-state `errors` from `extract-failure.json` (alongside the published
  `frames/frames-manifest.json` row) to drive inspect → score → correction-hint →
  regeneration. So error-driven regeneration keeps its *which state failed, and why* signal
  even though `frames/` holds only complete generations.
- The evidence is maintained **per state**, because a subset `--states` extract (the formal
  single-row / auto-correction path) only determines the outcome of the states it targets: a
  target state that succeeds is removed, a target state that fails is (re)recorded, and states
  the attempt did not touch keep their prior failure. So a `walk` success never erases an
  unresolved `idle` failure, and an `idle` failure never overwrites a `walk` one. The file is
  deleted only once **no** per-state failure remains (Consistency — never re-flag a now-good
  state, never silently drop a still-broken one).
- Advancing the two canonical surfaces is **one transaction**: `extract` swaps `frames/`
  and (re)writes/removes `extract-failure.json` under a single `publish_guard`, rolling
  **both** back together on any **in-process** I/O failure (a raised exception), so a reader
  never sees a new generation beside a stale failure record. Readers that combine them
  (`inspect` / the correction loop, via `inspect_run`) hold the matching `read_guard` for the
  whole read. (This rollback covers raised exceptions; a hard **process kill** mid-swap is a
  known durability gap — see the guarantee boundary in §7.)
- A **complete generation** is enforced beyond JSON schema: a finished-generation consumer
  (`compose_*` / `export_pngs` / `preview`) calls `extract.require_frames_manifest`, and
  `serve_curation` / `inspect` call `extract.load_consistent_frames_manifest`, which verify the
  manifest AGREES with the physical frame tree and the request — every request state has exactly
  one row, no physical frame dir is an orphan the manifest omits, and every row's canonical
  frames exist on disk. `{"ok":true,"rows":[]}` over real frames, a deleted frame, or frames with
  **no** manifest (an orphan, distinct from a fresh scaffold) all fail loud; `compose_gif` /
  `export_pngs` likewise fail on a missing selected frame instead of silently skipping it. A run
  with no generation at all (no manifest, no frames) still serves the request/state scaffold.
- A **corrupt** canonical record fails loud on **every** path — the writer *and* every reader.
  Extract's subset-seeding + commit, `inspect._manifest_state_notes`, and every
  finished-generation consumer (`compose_atlas` / `compose_cycle` / `compose_gif` /
  `export_pngs` / `preview` via `extract.require_frames_manifest`, and `serve_curation` via
  `extract.load_frames_manifest`) go through the shared typed loaders
  (`extract.load_frames_manifest` / `load_failure_evidence`) that refuse an unreadable /
  unparseable / broken-schema record (must be a `dict`; `errors`/`warnings`/`rows` lists whose
  entries are non-empty strings / `state`-bearing objects; a frames manifest must be `ok:true`,
  failure evidence `ok:false` with non-empty `state`-scoped `errors`) rather than treating it as
  empty. Absence still returns empty (a run with no generation yet); only an existing-but-broken
  record fails loud. Silently reading a corrupt `extract-failure.json` as "no failures", or a corrupt
  `frames/frames-manifest.json` as "no prior rows" (then publishing an incomplete manifest that
  disagrees with the carried frame tree), is exactly the No-Silent-Fallback violation this
  forbids. A corrupt prior manifest fails a subset re-extract loud **before** it stages
  anything, so the prior generation stays byte-intact.
- `compose_atlas` requires a complete generation: it fails loud if
  `frames/frames-manifest.json` is absent (a failed extract published none) and refuses a
  non-`ok` manifest, so a partial never becomes an atlas.

The curation view tolerates a run with **no generation** (no `frames/`, no manifest):
`serve_curation` falls back to an empty row set and `curation.run_revision` treats the missing
manifest as an empty fingerprint, so the view shows the request/state scaffold rather than
erroring. Physical frames *without* a manifest are an orphan, not a scaffold — that fails loud
(see the complete-generation bullet above).

## 7. Guarantee boundary — atomicity & concurrency (honest scope)

To avoid claiming guarantees the code does not provide (No Silent Fallback), this is the exact
boundary of the run-dir's atomicity and concurrency guarantees. What is **in force today**:

- **In-process transaction rollback.** The `frames/` + `extract-failure.json` commit (§6) and
  the `--force` re-import publish (§4) roll back on any raised exception, leaving the prior
  generation byte-intact. `atomic_write_text` / `os.replace` make each file write torn-free.
  `atomic_write_set` extends the same mechanism to a **set** that only means anything
  together — the layer bake's sheets, manifests and the report naming them: everything is
  staged before anything is renamed in, so a write error partway through publishes nothing
  (a `SIGKILL` between renames stays out of scope, below).
- **Reader isolation.** A publish holds the exclusive `publish_guard` for its swap; a reader
  sees a complete old-or-new snapshot, never a mix (§4). Where advisory locks are unavailable the
  guard **fails loud** (`RWLockUnavailable`), never a silent no-op. Every finished-generation
  consumer has exactly one named isolation strategy against a concurrent extract/import publish:
  - **shared `read_guard`** wrapping the whole manifest + curation + frame read —
    `serve_curation` (`/api/run` + static), `inspect`, `preview`, run-dir `compose_gif`,
    `compose_cycle`. They block only for the brief swap, then read a complete generation.
  - **writer exclusion** via the run-dir single-writer lock (`acquire_run_dir_lock`) —
    `compose_atlas`, `export_pngs`. They serialize with the extract writer, so they never overlap
    a publish at all.
  A consumer that only calls the manifest gate once but then reads the frame tree unguarded would
  leave a TOCTOU window; the full read must be inside the strategy.
- **Cross-process single-writer.** `.sprite-gen.lock` blocks a second **process** from writing
  the same run dir; the pipeline's **one worker owns one character folder** rule (§2, SKILL.md)
  is what excludes concurrent writers on the same run dir in the first place. Same-process
  re-entry is intentionally allowed so one interpreter can run prepare → extract → compose in
  sequence.

What is **intentionally out of scope** for this local, single-user, re-runnable tool — and so
not claimed here (a decision, not a deferral: maintainer 2026-07-12):

- **Process-kill durability.** A hard `SIGKILL` *between* the commit's rename steps can leave a
  new generation beside a stale `extract-failure.json` plus an orphan `.sg-backup`. This is **not
  silent corruption**: the consistency gate (§6) catches the mixed state and fails loud, and a
  re-run fixes it (the next extract's cleanup reconciles the leftover `.sg-backup` / `.sg-staging`).
  A journal / self-heal replay protocol would auto-heal it instead, but that is database-grade
  durability that a local sprite-curation tool does not need — observable-fail-loud + re-run is
  the deliberate design. In-process rollback (above) still covers every raised-exception case.
- **Thread-level write isolation.** `.sprite-gen.lock` re-entry is keyed per process, not per
  thread. This is a **non-scenario** under the pipeline's one-worker-owns-one-folder rule (§2,
  SKILL.md): concurrent writers on the same run dir are already excluded, and same-process
  re-entry is the *intended* path for one interpreter to run prepare → extract → compose in
  sequence. A thread-aware per-run mutex would only matter for a multi-threaded server host, which
  is not this tool.

Both are deliberate boundaries, not TODOs; §4/§6's atomicity claims are scoped to the in-process
cases above and do not contradict this. If sprite-gen is ever re-homed as a multi-user or server
service, revisit both here.
